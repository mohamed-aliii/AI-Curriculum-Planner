# AI-Curriculum-Planner
Here's a draft `README.md` file for your uploaded Jupyter Notebook `RL.ipynb`. It assumes the notebook is part of a project that implements a reinforcement learning system (likely related to academic advising based on our previous context). Let me know if you'd like to modify the focus or add usage examples.

# Reinforcement Learning-Based Academic Advisor

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** agent designed to simulate and optimize academic course selection strategies. It models student progress through a curriculum as a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** and uses RL to recommend personalized learning paths that maximize academic success and minimize time to graduation.

## üìò Notebook: `RL.ipynb`

The core implementation is contained in the Jupyter notebook `RL.ipynb`. It includes:

* Curriculum graph modeling
* Student state and environment definition
* Reward function design
* RL agent (e.g., Q-learning or policy-based)
* Training loop and evaluation
* Visualization of learning trajectories and policy outcomes

---

## üí° Key Features

* **Curriculum as a Graph**: Represents prerequisite relationships between courses using a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
* **Simulated Students**: Models student progress with constraints (e.g., max credits, failed courses).
* **Reward Engineering**: Encourages passing courses, avoiding overload, and graduating efficiently.
* **RL Policy**: Learns an optimal strategy for course selection based on past transitions.
* **Visualization**: Shows evolution of learning policy and progress paths.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

You can install the dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Typical dependencies include:

* `numpy`
* `networkx`
* `matplotlib`
* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn` (optional for metrics)
* `gym` (if using standard RL environments)
* `stable-baselines3` (if using advanced RL agents)

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the notebook.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook RL.ipynb
```

4. Execute the cells step by step to simulate, train, and visualize results.

---

## üìä Example Output

* Policy heatmaps showing course prioritization.
* Episode rewards tracking agent learning.
* Graduation paths under learned policy.

---

## üß† Future Enhancements

* Integrate real student performance data.
* Compare with heuristic methods (e.g., greedy, curriculum-following).
* Add curriculum constraints like semester availability or course caps.
* Use Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Policy Gradient methods.

## üìÑ License

This project is open-source under the MIT License.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like me to:

* Automatically extract or summarize parts of the notebook (e.g., what kind of RL is used).
* Create a `requirements.txt`.
* Add a command-line or API interface.
* Package this into a Python module or Streamlit app.

Would you like me to read the notebook and tailor this further?
